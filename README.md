# BluePOCO

Generate POCOs from Blueprint syntax

# Usage:

Get the APITransformer package from https://www.nuget.org/packages/BlueprintApiTransformer/ (or clone this project and compile your own!)

Add the transformer file to your project, edit as appropriate, use "Debug T4 Template" to generate (for some reason, standard running seems to yield a newtonsoft JSON error - I haven't gotten around to figuring out why, it doesn't happen in debug) - and enjoy your newly usable POCOs!


This project is created to complement a RestSharper extension to provide domain oriented design for fetching restul data.
